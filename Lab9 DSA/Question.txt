Write a program that implements subroutines that deploys the basic operations of a
binary search tree (BST). The program should have 5 functions createNode(),
insertNode(), searchNode(), deleteNode(), and displayBST(). The prototype and other
details for each of those functions are encoded as comments within the “tentative”
(hasn’t tested for bugs) wrapper program provided with. The program listWrapper.c is
an edited version of the one in Lab-05. You may start with the wrapper program as such
and modify if required.
You have been provided with the file testCaseForBST.txt from which your program
reads the input. Before termination, the program makes a call to the function
diplayBST() which prints the elements (the whole student record) sorted in descending
order of roll numbers.
