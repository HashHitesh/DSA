Implement subroutines that deploys the basic operations (prototype given below) of a
circular queue. Further, copy the same for linear queue from last week’s assignment.
You are provided with a program circularQueue.c that tabulates the number of
successful enqueue/dequeue operations in files circular_Qcount.txt and
linear_Qcount.txt respectively, for each of those test cases provided with. You may
assume the queue only to deal with positive integers. Plot testCaseSize Vs Qcount both
for linear and circular implementations (you would have two plots in a single XY-frame).
The dynamically allotted array circular_queue[] (linear_queue[]) refers to the memory
allotted for the abstract data type circular queue (linear queue) along with the
corresponding index variables frontC (frontL) and rearC (rearL), already being defined
and initialized to 0. The size of the array is in variable circular_queue_size
(linear_queue_size). You may use the same in the implementations of the functions
below.

int isLinearQueueEmpty() //returns 1 if the linear queue is empty and 0 otherwise
int isLinearQueueFull() //returns 1 if the linear queue is full and 0 otherwise
linearEnqueue(x) //enqueues the value x to the rear end of the linear queue, returns -1
if in case the queue is full
linearDequeue() //dequeues the value x from the front end of the linear queue, returns
-1 if in case the queue is empty
int isCircularQueueEmpty() //returns 1 if the circular queue is empty and 0 otherwise
int isCircularQueueFull() //returns 1 if the circular queue is full and 0 otherwise
circularEnqueue(x) //enqueues the value x to the rear end of the circular queue, returns
-1 if in case the queue is full
circularDequeue() //dequeues the value x from the front end of the circular queue,
returns -1 if in case the queue is empty

(a) Consider a huge array (say of size N) A[] containing a few positive integers
and -1 elsewhere. Let the number of positive integers in A[] be n and let them be
stored in a specific format as detailed below.
 A[0] is -1 and A[1] is a positive number
 If A[i] is a positive number and i>1 then A[⌊i/2⌋] is a positive number] is a positive number
where ⌊ is the floor function ⌋] is a positive number
Write a program (in C,C++, or Java) that would list all those positive numbers in
the array A[] in O(n) time, using a circular queue.
